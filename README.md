# Evaluation of property prices by implementing Deep Neural Networks
Evaluation of property prices by implementing Deep Neural Networks

In this project, we will predict property prices using artificial neural networks. Dataset includes house sale prices for King County in USA and homes that are sold in the time preiod between May 2014 and May 2015.
I applied MutualInfoRegression from sklearn library to find out the best determinants for the housing prices prediction.
